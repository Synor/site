title: Use as CLI
---

Synor has a CLI tool that you can use in your projects.

The first thing you'll need are the `@synor/cli` and `@synor/core` packages. Let's install them with the following command:

```sh
# using yarn:
yarn add @synor/cli @synor/core

# using npm:
npm install --save @synor/cli @synor/core
```

Next, you'll need a database engine and a source engine for Synor. You can write those yourself or use the [existing packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=synor). For this guide, let's assume we'll use PostgreSQL as the database and read the migration definition from local filesystem. So, let's install those packages too:

```sh
# using yarn:
yarn add @synor/database-postgresql @synor/source-file

# using npm:
npm install --save @synor/database-postgresql @synor/source-file
```

Now that we've installed all the necessary packages, we're ready to configure the CLI. Let's create the config file `.synorrc.js` with the following content:

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  databaseEngine: `@synor/database-postgresql`,
  databaseUri: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/synor`,

  sourceEngine: `@synor/source-file`,
  sourceUri: `file://${path.resolve('migrations')}`,

  baseVersion: '0000000000000',
  recordStartId: 1,
  migrationInfoNotation: {
    do: 'do',
    undo: 'undo',
    separator: '.',
    extension: 'sql',
  },
}
```

You can now put your schema migration sql scripts in the `./migrations` folder and start using the CLI commands.

According to the `migrationInfoNotation` set above, the filenames for the sql scripts would look like this:

**`1640995200000.do.add-column-active-in-table-user.sql`**:

```sql
alter table "user"
    add column "active" bool not null default TRUE;
```

**`1640995200000.undo.add-column-active-in-table-user.sql`**:

```sql
alter table "user"
    drop column "active";
```

Now you're ready to go. Run the following commands to get started:

```sh
synor help
synor info
```

That's it!
